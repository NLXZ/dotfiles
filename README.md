## Installation
I created a repository with an Ansible playbook to automatically setup Kali Linux with this dotfiles and some more configurations:  
[https://github.com/NLXZ/kali-setup](https://github.com/NLXZ/kali-setup)

Or just run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/NLXZ/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
stow -t "$HOME" -d dotfiles --adopt .
```
